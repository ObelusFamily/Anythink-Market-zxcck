# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

Clone the repo with `git clone`

Make sure Docker is installed and running.

You can verify docker is ready by running the following commands in your terminal: `docker -v` and `docker-compose -v`

Run `docker-compose up` from the project root directory to load Anythink's backend and frontend.

If Docker is working correctly, the backend should be running and able to connect to your local database.

Test this by pointing your browser to [http://localhost:3000/api/ping](http://localhost:3000/api/ping)

If everything is working properly, youâ€™ll be able to create a new user on [http://localhost:3001/register](http://localhost:3001/register)

You can use `docker exec` to run commands on a running containers.
